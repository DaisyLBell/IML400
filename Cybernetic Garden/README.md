    <h1>This<a href="https://daisylbell.github.io/IML400/Cybernetic%20Garden/CyberneticGarden.html">Cybernetic Garden</a> looks into a symbiotic relationsihp with technology, and how the digital realm can be used to benefit daily life.</h1>
    <h1>Details</h1>
    <h2>This website takes a personal look at the positive relationships people can have with technology. While the poem "All Watched over by Machines of Loving Grace" may be a bit naive by idealizing a symbiosis between nature and technology, our current negative reliance on technology does not have to persist. Of course, we would have to be cognizant of our habits in the digital realm. We can escape our current obsession and detriment caused by technology. We can find a way to use technology to solve our deap-seated societal issues. However, the use of technology might look different than it does now.</h2>
