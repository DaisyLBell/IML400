            <h4>After reading the piece analyzing the poem “All <br>Watched Over by the Grace of Loving Machine” through <br>the lens of 2020, I thought about my relationship <br>with technology and social media in the media <br>activism/ cancel culture era. I am of the belief that <br>social media can cultivate good mental health so long <br>as it is used in the correct capacity. An example is <br>screenshotting quotes on Pinterest. This activity can <br>help people rationalize their anxiety about the <br>future or get out of depressive moods. In my project, <br>I went through my images and my text messages with <br>loved ones and pulled some images that display media <br>usage that bolsters one another. The selected media <br>varied from memes to quotes by Morgan Harper Nichols <br>to text messages in my family group chat. Each image <br>is situated around the window space in the website, <br>however, this orientation will likely change as <br>JQuery is added to the website.
            <br>
            <br>In the foreground of the piece, I included my own <br>laptop. I felt like this would personalize the site <br>and cement the images into my own experience in the <br>digital world. The laptop is centered in a graphic of <br>grass, tying the entire website to the nature-focused <br>aspect of the aforementioned poem. I think that the <br>relation to nature is important because if we want <br>our relationship with the digital world to change, we <br>need to evaluate it from a humanized perspective. <br>There is a human on the receiving end of a comment, <br>regardless if a comment deserves critique or not. I <br>read somewhere that we can’t control everything that <br>happens to us or around us but we can choose how we <br>react to those things. We can choose how we respond <br>to technology, and make boundaries with it just like <br>we do with our friends and peers.</h4>

            <iframe src="https://dbell-digital-care.glitch.me/" style="width:600px;height:430px"></iframe>
            <h4>This website is an interactive page aiming to <br>rewrite the understanding of ever increasing <br> chronic illnesses. Since these conditions <br>and diseases last either for a significant period <br>of time or for an entire life, they have <br>significant impacts on those who receive a <br>diagnosis. Yet, since these illnesses impact almost <br>all aspects of a person’s lifestyle there is little <br>medical research done on more subjective side <br>effects of these conditions. Hence, it is important <br>for patients to share their experiences so that <br>they do not feel isolated in their human experience <br>and so that they feel as if they can reach the help <br>to improve health in whichever way they can. <br>Healing has a lot to do with mindset and it is time <br>the medical dialogue embraces it.</h4>

            <iframe src="https://mh-satire-json.glitch.me/" style="width:600px;height:430px"></iframe>
            <h4>Ever felt like you need to commiserate when grappling <br>with your mental health, or grappling with the <br>world’s dark truths? This website takes the position <br>that sometimes we have to get real and gritty to feel <br>better about where our heads are at, and cope with <br>the disappointing -yet real- aspects of the human <br>experience. The bottom line is that whatever you are <br>feeling at your core, you are not alone, and you <br>should not feel like you are. Ever. Please remember, <br>that, while this site is a satire, there is a <br>delicate balance between sarcasm and insult. Please <br>take care to remain on sarcasm's side of the balance.</h4>
